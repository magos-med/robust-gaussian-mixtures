# Robust Gaussian Mixtures

Clustering algorithms are widely adopted in different fields, both in academic research and in the industry. Their performance is usually affected by outliers, high dimensional data, and covariance matrix estimation errors. In this study, the application of non-parametric techniques for estimating the covariance matrix used in the Gaussian Mixtures clustering model is presented. The robust estimations of the covariance matrix are based on different types of correlation matrices: Spearman, Kendall, Ortiz-Laniado, and a variation of the Ortiz-Laniado correlation matrix proposed by the authors. It is shown experimentally that in the Gaussian Mixtures clustering, the robust methods outperform the standard Gaussian Mixtures method and the very popular K-Means algorithm, especially in cases where outliers or noise are present, or the clusters are very close to one another.
